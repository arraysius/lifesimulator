# Life Simulator

My work [_Life Simulator_](https://arraysius.github.io/lifesimulator/) aims to explore modes of control in technology, through the form of a questionnaire game. It aims to raise awareness about how consumer technology and social media companies exert certain amounts of control on our lives.

This is my submission for the final assignment in UTC2113 Gaming Life.
