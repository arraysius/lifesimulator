            <h1> <strong><em>Life Simulator</em></strong>:<br />Modes of Control in Technology</em></h1>
            <p>
              My work <em>Life Simulator</em> aims to explore modes of control in technology, through the form of a
              questionnaire game. It aims to raise awareness about how consumer technology and social media companies
              exert certain amounts of control on our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              The four modes of control explored in <em>Life Simulator</em> are agreements, the illusion of choice, the
              pressure to conform and inconvenience.

                <p>
                  Before using a product, users will always need to accept its terms and conditions. Often, users will
                  blindly accept these terms, trusting that the companies will operate fairly. These agreements usually
                  also request the user to give up certain rights. In Life Simulator, the player agrees to accept the
                  presented choices and attributed scores without complaint, but tech companies would request the user
                  to voluntarily provide data for advertising analytics. If users disagree with the terms, they will be
                  prevented from using the product.

                <h2>The Illusion of Choice</h2>
                <p>
                  Each question in Life Simulator presents three choices while smartphone app stores contain a large
                  catalogue of apps. Users will believe they have free will over the choices that they make. However, in
                  both scenarios, the choices have been pre-approved to be displayed. Published apps require a review by
                  the company that owns the app store before being listed. Any choice that a user makes will be within
                  the companyâ€™s accepted range of behaviour, hence giving the user the illusion of choice.

                <h2>The Pressure to Conform</h2>
                <p>
                  After completing Life Simulator, a table is shown commenting on the different range of scores and
                  their level of acceptability. A player with a high score is praised while a player with a low score is
                  criticised. Similarly, social media companies can promote accounts and posts sharing about positive
                  topics while banning those that share about controversial matters. As a result, the companies have set
                  a standard of what content users should share on their platforms. Hence, users face pressure to
                  conform to the rules so that they will remain on the platform.

                <h2>The Inconvenience</h2>
                <p>
                  The neutral choice is locked in every scenario presented in Life Simulator. It hints to the player
                  that alternative options are available but are difficult to achieve. The option can be unlocked but
                  will require additional effort. This parallels with the ability to load unofficial apps onto
                  smartphones. Although many users are unaware of alternative app stores, they are in fact available but
                  require certain technical knowledge to install unofficial apps. Thus, it might not be worth the effort
                  for the average user to learn the additional technical knowledge to enable such a feature. Installing
                  an unofficial app is too inconvenient and users are much more likely to the catalogue of pre-approved
                  apps.
